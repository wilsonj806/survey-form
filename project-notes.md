### Project notes:

* In terms of units you have
    - pixels `px`
    - inches/ centimeters `in,cm`
    - em/ rem
    - viewport width `vw`
    - viewport height `vh`
    - percent `%`
* Note that the following are relative units:
    - em/ rem
    - viewport width `vw`
    - viewport height `vh`
    - percent `%`
* Also note that the unit of `%` is relative to the parent element

* Designing for mobile first is pretty nice!
    - even if you need to make stuff into columns you can always toggle a column width at a breakpoint so it fits in
* Ended up not using any sort of test bed type files but that's a consequence of me finishing the project lightning fast
    - As in, could have finished the project in a day if I wanted to, fast
* There's probably a better way of getting the checkboxes into two aligned columns, probably by using `<ul>` but too late
    - On that note, there's probably a faster way of adding `<li>` elements in
